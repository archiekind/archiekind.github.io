        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Archie Kind, a Computer Science student at the University of Bristol with a passion for technology and the future of computing. 
           My interests range from machine learning to embedded software development, and I am continually expanding my skills. 
           Welcome to my personal website!</p>

        <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
        <p>
            During 2022-2023, I participated in the GKN Automotive Kevin Rye Memorial Skills Initiative, 
            a program spanning five weeks over the course of a year.
            Building on an earlier work experience opportunity with GKN Automotive, this placement provided hands-on exposure to 
            industry-specific tools such as MoTec for controlling valves and pumps, 
            as well as technologies like Controlled Area Networking (CAN). 
            Collaborating with the engineering team, I contributed to extending the software stack on test rigs by developing a footage 
            recording and logging system. This system enabled remote viewing by streaming video over the local area network (LAN).

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h3>University Course Work</h3>
        <p>
            During my time at university, I have developed several projects showcasing my technical skills. 
            One notable project was a C program for converting and compressing image files using a custom file format. 
            By employing 2D run-length encoding and various self-developed optimizations, I achieved a compression ratio of 6.03. 
            Another significant project involved designing a hardware implementation of the PRESENT encryption algorithm. 
            I extended this project by creating separate combinatorial, sequential, and pipelined designs while conducting extensive 
            research into Verilog efficiency, earning top marks for the coursework
        </p>
        <h3>Bristol HyPower Rocketry</h3>
        <p>
            As the Software Team Lead for Bristol HyPower Rocketry during the 2024/25 development cycle, I am guiding the development 
            of embedded systems for our rocket. We are competing in the European Rocketry Challenge, hosted by the Portuguese Space 
            Agency in October, with a target apogee of 3 km. This role has significantly extended my skills in embedded software 
            development, particularly with STM32 microcontroller boards.
        </p>
        <h3>Extended Project Qualification (a research-based academic program)</h3>
        <p>
            Researched, analysed and produced a 5000 word report on recent developments in language modelling, focusing on the SwiGLU activation, 
            grouped-query attention (GQA) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To collect primary data for my report I 
            built a 25m parameter <a href="https://github.com/archiekind/AMLM">language model</a> to conduct ablation tests.
