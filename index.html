        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Archie, a Computer Science student at the University of Bristol passionate about technology and the future of computing. 
           I'm engaged in everything from machine learning to embedded software development and am constantly learning new things to improve my skills. 
           Welcome to my personal website!</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <!-- <p>I've worked on various exciting projects ranging from web development to AI. 
            I built a <a href="https://github.com/archiekind/AMLM">language model</a> to inform my EPQ
            and a <a href="https://github.com/archiekind/tennisstats">tennis stats website</a> used for analysing tennis matches.
            Some projects were development while on a placement at GKN Automotive so can't be shared.
        </p> -->
        <p>
            My experience spans a variety of projects and I am constantly engaged in new and evolving initiatives.
        </p>
        <h3>Course Work</h3>
        <p>
            I've developed various projects during my time at University. A notable example was a C program to convert and compress image files
            using a custom file format. By using 2D run length encoding and a variety of other optimisations I developed myself, I achieved a compression
            ratio of 6.03. A second significant project was designing a hardware implementation of the PRESENT encryption algorithm. I extended
            the project by designing separate combinatorial, sequential and pipelined designs, and did extensive research into efficiency in Verilog
            earning full marks on the coursework.
        </p>
        <h3>Bristol HyPower Rocketry</h3>
        <p>
            I'm leading Software team for the Bristol HyPower rocketry for the 2024/25 development cycle. 
            We compete in the <a href="https://euroc.pt/#home">European Rocketry Challenge</a> hosted by the Portugese Space Agency
            with a target Apogee of 3km. This has extended my knowledge of embedded software development specifically with STM32 boards.
        </p>
        <h3>Extended Project Qualification</h3>
        <p>
            Researched, analysed and produced a 5000 word report on recent developments in language modelling, focusing on the SwiGLU activation, 
            grouped-query attention (GQA) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To collect primary data for my report I 
            built a 25m parameter <a href="https://github.com/archiekind/AMLM">language model</a> to conduct ablation tests.
